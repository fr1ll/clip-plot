    "## üöß Work in progress\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this repo is to modify [`pix-plot`](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot) to work as a front end for exploring any image embeddings, for example those from [`clip_retrieval`](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to go directly from a folder of JPGs to a PixPlot visualization, you should use [`pix-plot`](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot) itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is merely a work-in-progress attempt to enable you to generate a PixPlot visualization after creating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this?\n",
    "1. `clip` gives useful embeddings as shown by the [first place solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-universal-image-embedding/discussion/359316) in the recent \"Google Universal Image Embeddings\" Kaggle competition\n",
    "2. Separating the embeddings step gives more flexibility in how it is run -- for example, it can be run in parallel on several nodes\n",
    "3. Separating the embeddings step also makes it easier to remove pinned dependencies so the exciting viz stuff is easier to install\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial ambitions coming from PixPlot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚òëÔ∏è Unpin requirements versions\n",
    "- ‚¨õ Remove all TensorFlow dependencies\n",
    "- ‚¨õ Enable to go directly from what you'd expect to have after running `clip-retrieval` inference: i.e. a folder of JPGs and a folder with embeddings in numpy format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Later ambitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚¨õ Add a linear dimensionality reduction method to complement UMAP\n",
    "- ‚¨õ Include option to output as a desktop app via Tauri\n",
    "- ‚¨õ BYO logo\n",
