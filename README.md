## üöß Work in progress

The goal of this repo is to modify
[`pix-plot`](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot) to work as a front
end for exploring any image embeddings, for example those from
[`clip_retrieval`](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval).

If you want to go directly from a folder of JPGs to a PixPlot
visualization, you should use
[`pix-plot`](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot) itself.

This is merely a work-in-progress attempt to enable you to generate a
PixPlot visualization after creating embeddings.

Why do this? 1. `clip` gives useful embeddings as shown by the [first
place
solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-universal-image-embedding/discussion/359316)
in the recent ‚ÄúGoogle Universal Image Embeddings‚Äù Kaggle competition 2.
Separating the embeddings step gives more flexibility in how it is run ‚Äì
for example, it can be run in parallel on several nodes 3. Separating
the embeddings step also makes it easier to remove pinned dependencies
so the exciting viz stuff is easier to install

Initial ambitions coming from PixPlot:

- ‚òëÔ∏è Unpin requirements versions
- ‚¨õ Remove all TensorFlow dependencies
- ‚¨õ Enable to go directly from what you‚Äôd expect to have after running
  `clip-retrieval` inference: i.e.¬†a folder of JPGs and a folder with
  embeddings in numpy format

Later ambitions

- ‚¨õ Add a linear dimensionality reduction method to complement UMAP
- ‚¨õ Include option to output as a desktop app via Tauri
- ‚¨õ BYO logo

`clip-plot` is a fork of
[`pix-plot`](https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot) by [Douglas
Duhaime](https://github.com/duhaime), [Peter
Leonard](https://github.com/pleonard212), and others, and is mainly a
lighter, smaller version of their work.
